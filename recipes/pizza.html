    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.</p>
    <p>In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork. In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir water, sugar and yeast together until dissolved. Add the olive oil and the salt. Stir in the flour until well blended. Let dough rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pat dough into pan or on to a pizza stone using fingers dipped in olive oil. If desired sprinkle basil, thyme or other seasonings on crust. Top with your favorite pizza toppings and bake for 15 to 20 minutes in a preheated 425 degree oven.</li>
    </ol>
