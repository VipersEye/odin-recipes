    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Guacamole (Spanish: [(ɡ)wakaˈmole] (audio speaker iconlisten); (informally shortened to guac in the United States since the 1980s) is an avocado-based dip, spread, or salad first developed in Mexico. In addition to its use in modern Mexican cuisine, it has become part of international and American cuisine as a dip, condiment and salad ingredient.</p>
    <p>The name comes from Classical Nahuatl āhuacamōlli [aːwakaˈmoːlːi], which literally translates to 'avocado sauce', from āhuacatl [aːˈwakat͡ɬ] 'avocado' + mōlli [ˈmoːlːi] 'sauce'. In Mexican Spanish, it is pronounced [wakaˈmole], in American English, it tends to be pronounced /ˌɡwɑːkəˈmoʊliː/, and in British English, /ˌɡwɑːkəˈmoʊleɪ/.</p>
